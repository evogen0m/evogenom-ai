- Prefer `const` over `let` when variables won't be reassigned
- Use arrow functions for better lexical scoping and concise syntax
- Utilize TypeScript's type system fully: use interfaces, type aliases, and generics where appropriate
- Implement error handling with custom error types
- Write pure functions where possible to improve testability and reduce side effects
- When running tests, use `pnpm test -- <test file path>` to run the relevant tests
- Test files are located next to the code module, with spec.ts suffix
